# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

Apologies for the mess. YMMV.

After 5 games (and uses averages of the most recent 5 games),
1. If you have an average score below 3, it turns the drop function off.
2. If you have an average score below 5, it turns off the random chunks that appear.
3. If you have an average score above 20, it reverses the controls (left & right) and (rotate & drop).
4. If you have an average of above 10 and the score is increasing, it starts obsuring your vision.
5. If you have an average of above 10 and the score is decreasing, it reverses the obscuring of your vision.
